Repository Set-up
Create a new repository on GitHub named portfolio. Clone it to your local file system.
From the command line, copy the contents of the starter-code folder from the course repository into the root of your portfolio repository. Play around with the cp command until you get it exactly right. Don't worry if you don't get it right the first time, just clear out the attempt, and try again.
Add and commit this initial state of the code base to your master branch.
From this point on, work on semantically-named non-master branches. Remember to add, commit, and push regularly.
